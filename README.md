# ES Lint demo files

This Repo contains the example files used in the ES Lint Tutorial at <a href="https://www.learnbycheating.com/subjects/vscode/how-to-use-eslint">learnbycheating.com/subjects/vscode/how-to-use-eslint</a>

The app.js file has JavaScript code containing issues.

App-finish.js has all the issues corrected.

To get the starting code, click the Releases link. There are two releases. 

v1-ESLint-starting-code.

v2-ESLint-ending-code.

Under the v1-ESLint-starting-code, click the Source Code link to download it. 

The only difference between the beginning and ending code is the installation of the ESLint npm packages and the .eslintrc.json configuration file.
